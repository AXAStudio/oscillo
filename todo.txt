add average cost to positions table, update average cost every time we submit an order
compute all time p&ls based on current price - avg cost
remove day change

performance  I would make a whole new project to make sure it works
- use orders and price_df as input (see services/performance)
portfolio market value and performance should both include cash - portfolio market value is taken from returned current value when you call get portfolio
get rid of total p&l kpi and total return KPI card (replace with an outstanding cash KPI card)
